# Kabuki
Human behavior using behavior trees via Active Logic [DRAFT]

**This repository is a DRAFT; you are free to look around and may find inspiration here, however Kabuki is not ready for prime time**

## What?

A sample Unity project created to demonstrate simple actions (push, grab, tell, ...) using behavior trees (BT).

## Prerequisites

- [Active Logic](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/active-logic-151850)
- [Howl](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/localization/howl-the-symbolic-notation-for-c-177081)
- [Basic motions](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-free-pack-154271)
- [Prop animations](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/props-animations-10214)

Some of the above assets are not free; I do not currently earn a commission on the above links.

## Usage

Find inspiration in the source. Currently only Howl source is provided. I will create a C# mirror at a later date.
With the current prerequisites, you may also build and run play mode tests.
