# Kabuki
Human behavior using behavior trees via Active Logic [DRAFT]

**This repository is a DRAFT; you are free to look around, however Kabuki is not ready for prime time**

## What?

A sample Unity project created to demonstrate simple actions (push, grab, tell, ...) using behavior trees (BT).
The idea is to provide a concise foundation for learning about BT and Active Logic; sample project to build from.

## Prerequisites

- [Active Logic](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/active-logic-151850) (v1.3 required, eta Nov. 2020)
- [Howl](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/localization/howl-the-symbolic-notation-for-c-177081) (v1.1 required, eta Nov 2020)
- [Basic motions](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-free-pack-154271)
- [Prop animations](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/props-animations-10214)

Some of the above assets are not free; later this repository may include licensed animations and models.
I do not earn a commission on the above links.

## Usage

Find inspiration [in the source](Assets/Kabuki/Runtime/Actor.howl). C# sources live [here](Assets/~build/Kabuki/).

With the referred prerequisites (or equiv), you may also build and run play mode tests.

## Future

- Currently, reviewing implementations
- Will provide alternative implementations ('classic' mecanim and legacy animation integrations)
- Pure C# mirror
